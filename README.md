# Documentation

To gain access to the program, first clone the repository.

After starting Docker log in via Postman and localhost with the following details:

username: `user`
password: `uek_295` 

or 

username: `user2` 
password: `uek295_2` 

Then run the program on intelliJ.

You can access the localhost [here](http://localhost:8080/rank) and my swagger documentation [here](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/)

Enjoy!
